        "In our previous notebook, we confirmed that data augmentation is a highly effective strategy for improving our model's performance and reducing overfitting. We saw a significant jump in accuracy and a much more balanced model when we expanded our training set with simple augmentations.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will take that concept a step further. We will implement a more advanced and robust augmentation pipeline:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Introduce a New Augmentation:** We will add **time shifting** to our set of tools. This simulates the sound starting at a slightly different time.\n",
        "2.  **Randomized Augmentation:** Instead of creating a fixed set of augmentations for each audio clip (e.g., one with noise, one with a pitch shift), we will create multiple augmented versions where each version has a **randomly chosen augmentation** applied. This creates a much more diverse and less predictable training set, which is a very powerful technique for forcing the model to learn the core features of the sound.\n",
        "3.  **Train and Evaluate:** We will then train a new binary CNN on this more richly augmented dataset and compare its performance to our previous models.\n"
